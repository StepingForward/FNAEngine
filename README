This is a REALLY small 2d framework made in C# with FNA, i was just tring out FNA, and ended u pliking it a lot.
## What it has:
  --loading all game content
  --animations [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
  --sprite atlases
  --entities
  --tilemap(support for Ogmo Tilemap editor)
You may see collisions in Entity.cs but they don't work, don't even look at them.
There is no reason for you to use this, but if you want to use my code, you can FREELY.
## Instalation
Create a new FNA project as you would usually, but don't bind FNACore to your main project bind it to the engine instead and then bind the engine to your main project.
That's atleast how I did it.
I will say, that you can find some useful code here like: camera, tilemap loading, animations and sprite atlases(at least i hope they are good), 
            first public project :)
